- Attack simulations for several password spray and illicit consent grant attack scenarios.
- The code implementation of the Autoencoder and Isolation Forest models used in the Methodology section.


<h2> Brute-force events Logs </h2>

Some examples of event logs generated during the simulation of a <b>Password Spray</b> and a <b>Password Guessing</b> attack can be found in the [Brute-force attempts](https://github.com/Stefan-Cracea/AzureAD-Monitoring-Research/tree/main/Brute-force%20attempts) directory.
